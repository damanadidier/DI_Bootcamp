# Exercise 1: Converting Lists into Dictionaries
# Key Python Topics:

# Creating dictionaries
# Zip function or dictionary comprehension


# Instructions

# You are given two lists. Convert them into a dictionary where the first list contains the keys and the second list contains the corresponding values.



# Lists:

# keys = ['Ten', 'Twenty', 'Thirty']
# values = [10, 20, 30]

keys = ['Ten', 'Twenty', 'Thirty']
values = [10, 20, 30]

# Using zip function
my_dict = dict(zip(keys, values))
print(my_dict)

# Exercise 2: Cinemax #2
# Key Python Topics:

# Looping through dictionaries
# Conditionals
# Calculations


# Instructions

# Write a program that calculates the total cost of movie tickets for a family based on their ages.

# Family members’ ages are stored in a dictionary.
# The ticket pricing rules are as follows:
# Under 3 years old: Free
# 3 to 12 years old: $10
# Over 12 years old: $15


# Family Data:

# family = {"rick": 43, 'beth': 13, 'morty': 5, 'summer': 8}


# Loop through the family dictionary to calculate the total cost.
# Print the ticket price for each family member.
# Print the total cost at the end.


# Bonus:

# Allow the user to input family members’ names and ages, then calculate the total ticket cost.
family = {"rick": 43, 'beth': 13, 'morty': 5, 'summer': 8}
total_cost = 0

for name, age in family.items():
    if age < 3:
        cost = 0
    elif 3 <= age <= 12:
        cost = 10
    else:
        cost = 15
    
    print(f"{name} (age {age}): ${cost}")
    total_cost += cost

print(f"Total cost for the family: ${total_cost}")

# Exercise 4 : Some Geography
# Goal: Create a function that describes a city and its country.

# Key Python Topics:

# Functions with multiple parameters
# Default parameter values
# String formatting


# Step 1: Define a Function with Parameters

# Define a function named describe_city().
# This function should accept two parameters: city and country.
# Give the country parameter a default value, such as “Unknown”.


# Step 2: Print a Message

# Inside the function, set up the code to display a sentence like “ is in “.
# Replace <city> and <country> with the parameter values.


# Step 3: Call the Function

# Call the describe_city() function with different city and country combinations.
# Try calling it with and without providing the country argument to see the default value in action.
# Example: describe_city("Reykjavik", "Iceland") and describe_city("Paris").


# Expected Output:

# Reykjavik is in Iceland.
# Paris is in Unknown.

def describe_city(city, country="Unknown"):
    print(f"{city} is in {country}.")

describe_city("Reykjavik", "Iceland")
describe_city("Paris")

# Exercise 5 : Random
# Goal: Create a function that generates random numbers and compares them.

# Key Python Topics:

# random module
# random.randint() function
# Conditional statements (if, else)


# Step 1: Import the random Module

# At the beginning of your script, use import random to access the random number generation functions.


# Step 2: Define a Function with a Parameter

# Create a function that accepts a number between 1 and 100 as a parameter.


# Step 3: Generate a Random Number

# Inside the function, use random.randint(1, 100) to generate a random integer between 1 and 100.


# Step 4: Compare the Numbers

# If they are the same, print a success message. Otherwise, print a fail message and display both numbers.


# Step 5: Call the Function

# Call the function with a number between 1 and 100.


# Expected Output:

# Success! (if the numbers match)
# Fail! Your number: 50, Random number: 23 (if they don't match)

import random
def compare_random_number(user_number):
    random_number = random.randint(1, 100)
    if user_number == random_number:
        print("Success!")
    else:
        print(f"Fail! Your number: {user_number}, Random number: {random_number}")

compare_random_number(50)

# Exercise 6 : Let’s create some personalized shirts !
# Goal: Create a function to describe a shirt’s size and message, with default values.

# Key Python Topics:

# Functions with parameters and default values
# Keyword arguments


# Step 1: Define a Function with Parameters

# Define a function called make_shirt().
# This function should accept two parameters: size and text.


# Step 2: Print a Summary Message

# Set up the function to display a sentence summarizing the shirt’s size and message.


# Step 3: Call the Function



# Step 4: Modify the Function with Default Values

# Modify the make_shirt() function so that size has a default value of “large” and text has a default value of “I love Python”.


# Step 5: Call the Function with Default and Custom Values

# Call make_shirt() to make a large shirt with the default message.
# Call make_shirt() to make a medium shirt with the default message.
# Call make_shirt() to make a shirt of any size with a different message.


# Step 6 (Bonus): Keyword Arguments

# Call make_shirt() using keyword arguments (e.g., make_shirt(size="small", text="Hello!")).


# Expected Output:

# The size of the shirt is large and the text is I love Python.
# The size of the shirt is medium and the text is I love Python.
# The size of the shirt is small and the text is Custom message.

# Step 1-3: initial function without defaults
def make_shirt(size, text):
    print(f"The size of the shirt is {size} and the text is {text}.")

make_shirt("large", "I love Python")

# Step 4-5: modified function with default values
def make_shirt(size="large", text="I love Python"):
    print(f"The size of the shirt is {size} and the text is {text}.")

make_shirt()
make_shirt(size="medium")
make_shirt(size="small", text="Custom message")

# Step 6 (Bonus): keyword arguments
make_shirt(size="small", text="Hello!")


# Exercise 7 : Temperature Advice
# Goal: Generate a random temperature and provide advice based on the temperature range.

# Key Python Topics:

# Functions
# Conditionals (if / elif)
# Random numbers
# Floating-point numbers (Bonus)
# Handling seasons (Bonus)


# Step 1: Create the get_random_temp() Function

# Create a function called get_random_temp() that returns a random integer between -10 and 40 degrees Celsius.


# Step 2: Create the main() Function

# Create a function called main(). Inside this function:
# Call get_random_temp() to get a random temperature.
# Store the temperature in a variable and print a friendly message like:
# “The temperature right now is 32 degrees Celsius.”


# Step 3: Provide Temperature-Based Advice

# Inside main(), provide advice based on the temperature:
# Below 0°C: e.g., “Brrr, that’s freezing! Wear some extra layers today.”
# Between 0°C and 16°C: e.g., “Quite chilly! Don’t forget your coat.”
# Between 16°C and 23°C: e.g., “Nice weather.”
# Between 24°C and 32°C: e.g., “A bit warm, stay hydrated.”
# Between 32°C and 40°C: e.g., “It’s really hot! Stay cool.”


# Step 4: Floating-Point Temperatures (Bonus)

# Modify get_random_temp() to return a random floating-point number using random.uniform() for more accurate temperature values.


# Step 5: Month-Based Seasons (Bonus)

# Instead of directly generating a random temperature, ask the user for a month (1-12) and determine the season using if/elif conditions.
# Modify get_random_temp() to return temperatures specific to each season.


# Expected Output:

# The temperature right now is 32 degrees Celsius.
# It's really hot! Stay cool.

import random

# Step 5 (Bonus): Month-Based Seasons — map a month number to a season.
def get_season(month):
    if month in (12, 1, 2):

    if month in (3, 4, 5):
        return "spring"
    if month in (6, 7, 8):
        return "summer"
    return "autumn"

# Step 1: get_random_temp() returns a random temperature.
# Step 4 (Bonus): use random.uniform() to return a floating-point value.
# Step 5 (Bonus): temperature range depends on the season.
def get_random_temp(season):
    if season == "winter":
        return random.uniform(-10, 5)
    if season == "spring":
        return random.uniform(5, 20)
    if season == "summer":
        return random.uniform(20, 40)
    return random.uniform(5, 20)  # autumn

# Step 2: main() calls get_random_temp() and prints a friendly message.
# Step 3: provide advice based on the temperature range.
def main():
    # Step 5 (Bonus): ask the user for a month to determine the season.
    month = int(input("Enter the month number (1-12): "))
    season = get_season(month)

    temp = get_random_temp(season)
